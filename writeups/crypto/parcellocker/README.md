## Description

These new parcel lockers promise convenience: no queues, no staff, and 24/7 access. Everything is managed through a web UI, complete with API documentation at `/api/docs`. Your task as a user is simple: open the app, claim your parcel, and the assigned locker slot will unlock.

However, rumours are spreading - someone has already found a way to open any slot in any locker. Can you do it too?
